"It'll be your downfall one day." And it has been the downfall of many a Law & Order: UK, too, dwelling far too much on prosecutor Steel's passionate crusade to uphold his principles, rather than the procedural nuts and bolts we enjoy. But as series four opens there are signs the writers may have put Steel's high horse in the stable for now. So what we get is a solid, absorbing crime drama, the kind of no-frills narrative the original Law & Order franchises were built on. We also get the wonderful Ronnie (Bradley Walsh) facing down an armed teenager and classy guest turns from Lorcan Cranitch as a suspect whose wedding day is approaching and Eddie Marsan (always worth watching) as a gangster's brief. It all begins with a former footballer who is found dead in a back street next to his sports car, killed with a wheel brace while changing his tyre. A watch worth Â£30,000 has been stolen, but was that the motive? Ronnie will need to lay his pasties, burgers and bags of chips aside for long enough to find out. He should be the size of a whale.               Radio Times reviewer - David Butcher~true~07/03/2011~21:00~22:00~60

Luckily for her ITV1's celebrity travel outreach programme (famous? Want to go abroad and make a broad-brush popular documentary series? Then let us help!) is on hand. Quentin, who's giggly and likeable, does everything you'd expect a tourist to do. She visits the Taj Mahal (for about 40 seconds of screen time) and does a Princess Diana pose on a bench; she travels overnight on a train, surely a visa requirement for any celeb in India and she eats a lovely meal cooked by an Indian person. To be honest, we don't learn a lot - the Ganges is a bit dirty, India is hot and busy and the people are lovely - but Quentin isn't trying to be John Simpson. Just look upon it as a string of effusive postcards from a pal.               Radio Times reviewer - Alison Graham~true~08/03/2011~21:00~22:00~60

His hopes are dashed, however, when he realises he's only been summoned to appear in the celebrity audience. Refusing to curl up and dye, he charms his way into the contest via hard-nosed Hollywood agent Frances Fisher, millionaire sponsor Charles Napier and a bunch of Tinseltown eccentrics. The result is an intermittently amusing affair - having Ferguson's exploits filmed by a fly-on-the-wall documentary crew is an awkward device - although the actual competition, complete with bitchy rivals, conditioner sabotage and ludicrous hairdos, is a cut above the rest of the humour. Director Kevin Allen (Twin Town) was clearly aiming for a shampoo-and-set Strictly Ballroom, but he misses that feel-good target by miles.~false~08/03/2011~22:35~00:10~95

UEFA Champions League Live~~Tottenham Hotspur v AC Milan~~~~false~false~false~true~true~false~false~false~~~Sport~After winning against all odds in Italy at the San Siro, Spurs have a 1-0 advantage as they take on Italian league leaders AC Milan in what should be a pulsating return leg at White Hart Lane. It was a truly magnificent win by Harry Redknapp's team two weeks ago, and Milan will have to throw everything at Spurs to try to make up the deficit. Redknapp is unlikely to rely on a risky strategy of containment. Far better for the home side to strike an upbeat tempo, higher than the Italian team are used to, and hope that the visitors' ageing legs will see Milan's challenge fade away. It certainly appears that the best days of 30-somethings Alessandro Nesta, Clarence Seedorf and Zlatan Ibrahimovic are behind them, while the incendiary Gennaro Gattuso is suspended. You'd imagine that if Spurs score first, it will knock the stuffing out of Milan. But if it's the other way round, the match could get very tasty.

In fact, little beyond the basic premise makes much sense, as special agent Jason Scott Lee (replacing original star Jean-Claude Van Damme) skips back and forth in time to stop a vengeful renegade (Thomas Ian Griffith) from erasing him and his colleagues from history. After a promising opening set in Nazi Germany, the plot becomes so fragmented that scenes completely lose their cohesion, preventing any build-up of suspense. Poor effects and fake-looking sets compound the film's problems, though at least Lee's martial arts skills ensure some decent fight sequences.~false~10/03/2011~02:30~03:55~85

Monroe doesn't so much hit the ground running as sprint, do the long jump and pole-vault before performing a lap of honour. James Nesbitt is Gabriel Monroe, a gifted neurosurgeon who tells it like it is and fears no one. If there were a rulebook lying around somewhere, he would probably pick it up and throw it from the nearest window. Yet his breezy exterior hides A Hidden Hurt that has damaged his soul. So far, so maverick. And yes, apart from the breezy bit and the lack of a limp, we are straying dangerously into House territory here. But writer Peter Bowker manages to stop us from gagging on nonconformist-medic clichÃ©s because his writing is so good, so knowing and, when it needs to be, funny. Even the required sexual tension between Monroe and crack cardiologist Jenny Bremner (super Sarah Parish) is brisk and brittle when she declares herself "indifferent to your twinkly self-regard". A nice line. The first patient-of-the-week is a young bank worker (Sarah Smart) with a tumour. Immediately we see Monroe's modus operandi: cheerful honesty and an apparent flippancy that hides his brilliance. He could be tiresome, but Nesbitt keeps him under control.

Though it's jam-packed with marvellously staged numbers like Hey, Big Spender, Rhythm of Life and If My Friends Could See Me Now, the film is brash, gaudy and overheated. It lacks the sophisticated edge and sharp impact of the stage original, with Shirley MacLaine's turbine-powered Charity substituting energy for subtlety.

Meeting "by chance" in a city bookshop, the pair talk of the past (they had vowed to meet up six months after their night in Vienna), their present and possible futures during the course of a 70-minute stroll that plays out in real time. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy reprise the roles of Jesse and CÃ©line, slipping effortlessly back into them while adding layers of age and experience. Linklater directs his often perceptive script (co-written with Delpy and Hawke) with economy and quiet style. Fans of the first film will need no urging to see this sequel, but those who missed the first meeting of Jesse and CÃ©line may feel a little left out in the cold, as an already developed affection for these talky and at times pretentious characters is a definite bonus.~false~15/03/2011~22:35~00:10~95

Revelling in local idiosyncrasies, director Michael Caton-Jones gives the film a lovely golden glow and produces a Capra-like hymn to the small town as Fox's dreams of becoming a rich cosmetic surgeon are put on hold. It's insubstantial, but corny fun all the same, and Fox is as charming as ever. The talented supporting cast includes Woody Harrelson, Bridget Fonda and David Odgen Stiers; look out, too, for a neat cameo from George Hamilton near the end.~false~19/03/2011~14:15~16:15~120

Adapted from Christianna Brand's Nurse Matilda books, it's the story of seven Victorian youngsters whose behaviour is so beastly that they've driven away 17 nannies. Their conduct worsens when they learn that their widowed father (Colin Firth) is planning to remarry, however salvation is at hand in the form of stern and comically ugly Nanny McPhee (Thompson). Armed with a magic stick, mysterious McPhee is like an updated Mary Poppins, turning her charges' antics against them in a series of darkly amusing sequences. Though the over-tens might find the feature a tad twee, younger viewers will love its imaginative mayhem and mischievous dialogue. Stylistically, too, the movie is delightful, with an exaggerated fairy-tale look that complements the deliberately pantomimic performances. Ultimately, the conclusion may seem mawkish and predictable, but they're forgivable flaws in an otherwise well-pitched production.~false~19/03/2011~16:15~18:05~110

GoldenEye director Martin Campbell injects some Bourne-style grit into the proceedings, upping the violence content (the opening sequence, shot in grainy black and white, is particularly brutal). He also strips Bond of much of the slightly camp humour - thus no appearance from gadget-man Q. The plot is essentially an origins story, as a rough-around-the-edges Bond gains his two zeros (the two authorised kills he needs for his infamous licence) before tackling villain Le Chiffre (a splendidly thin-lipped Mads Mikkelsen) in a game of high-stakes poker. Craig's humanised, more flawed interpretation of the role balances Campbell's physical direction and co-writer Paul Haggis's sparing wit, while Eva Green provides an alluring love interest. Apart from a chaotic and overlong last act, this is a triumphant new beginning.~false~19/03/2011~22:15~23:30~75
